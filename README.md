# Typewriter Animated Messages

### Adds a typewriter effect to messages.
| <img alt="typewriter effect looks like this" src="./resources/typewriter.gif"/>              |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">How the typewriter effect looks.<span> |

### Settings:

- **Speed**: The speed of the typewriter effect/ delay between each letter in milliseconds.


- **ShowCursor**: Select whether the cursor at the end of the message should appear as it's typing.
 
 
- **Channels**: Channel IDs where the typing effect is enabled (comma-separated).


- **channelTypeToAffect**: What type of channel to enable the animation (All, DMs, GroupDMs, etc.).


### WIP:
- Add a glow to the cursor and animated text to give it a more realistic effect with a setting to toggle.
